Boston House price prediction

Today i used BostonHousePrice which is available in scikit-learn libraray.

I use KNeighborsRegressor model for predicting the house prices.

So What is KNeighborsRegressor?
KNeighborsRegressor is used to calculate the average of the numerical target of the kNeighborsClassifier.

And for the accuracy i used root mean squared error(RMSE).
